### 0. Use a private key mandatory

> - Requirements:

>> - Only use ssh single-character flags
>> - You cannot use -l
>> - You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase


### 1. Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

>- Requirements:

>> - Name of the created private key must be holberton
>> - Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
>> - The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty

### 2. Client configuration file

> Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

> - Requirements:

>> - Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton
>> - Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password

### 3. Let me in!
> Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.

> Add the SSH public key below to your server so that we can connect using the ubuntu user.
