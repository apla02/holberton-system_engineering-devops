    What is a PID
        A PID (i.e., process identification number) is an identification number that is automatically assigned
        to each process when it is created on a Unix-like operating system. 

    What is a process
        A process is an executing (i.e., running) instance of a program. Each process is guaranteed a unique PID,
        which is always a non-negative integer. 
        since 1( process init) until 32767

    How to find a processâ€™ PID
        echo $$

    how to run and display all the processes

        ps -aux -f (all format) -H (herarchy)
        ps aux 

        A : Select all processes
        u : Select all processes on a terminal, including those of other users
        x : Select processes without controlling ttys

    To get a name of process, I can  use -l:

        pgrep -l '^[Aa]'

    To get the command line and can use -a:

        pgrep -a '^[Aa]'
c
    To infinity loop with a sleep wait I can use sleep

         while :; do echo 'Hit CTRL+C'; sleep 1; done
        while true; do echo 'Hit CTRL+C'; sleep 1; done

    How to kill a process
        kill $(pgrep -f ./4-to_infinity_and_beoyond) --> is full information, process contain this name 

        pkill is easier than kill, just need pkill and -flags and the name of the process, also could be a path

        killall
