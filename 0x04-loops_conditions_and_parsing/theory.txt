    What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
        The advantage of #!/usr/bin/env bash is that it will use whatever
        bash executable appears first in the running userâ€™s $PATH variable.
        Now you do not have to search for a program via the PATH environment 
        variable. It makes the script more portable. Also, note that it is not
        a foolproof method.
