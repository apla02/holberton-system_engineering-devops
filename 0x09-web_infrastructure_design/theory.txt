      You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure: 
    • What is a server 
        A server is a device, a virtual device or computer program or providing functionality for other programs or devices, called “clients”.
    
    • What is the role of the domain name 
        serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than
        the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols. A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances.

    • What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
        CNAME 
    • What is the role of the web server 
        A web server is a software that serves web pages to clients upon their request, it does this over the protocol HTTP.

    • What is the role of the application server
        An application server is a server that hosts applications. Application server frameworks are software frameworks for building application servers.
        An application server framework provides both facilities to create web applications and a server environment to run them.

    • What is the role of the database 
        Is a collection of information that is stored and organized so that it can be easily accessed, updated and managed. it comunnicate with the app server and the codebase


    • What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website 
        TCP /IP through HTTP port 80
    • What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works 
        There are many. For instance: 
    • Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both 
        
    • How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works 
    
    • What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
    
    • What are firewalls for
        is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
        A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet 
    
    • Why is the traffic served over HTTPS 
        site served over https is more secure. Since https uses the secure port 443, which encrypts outgoing information, it is much more difficult
        for people to spy on your site's information. Regular http, on the other hand, uses port 80, which sends information via plain text.
    • What monitoring is used for 
        Its purpose is to collect and analyze data from the IT infrastructure
        and to leverage that data to improve business results and drive value creation for the organization.

    • How the monitoring tool is collecting data 
        Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
        Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

    • Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
      
    You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure: 
    • SPOF 
    • Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted) 
    • Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic 
    • Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS) 
    • No monitoring
    • Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue 
    • Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue 
    • Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
